Class 3 - 

Points from Felipe Campelo


* R basics
* Data reading in R 
* Basic Statistics (Campelo Class)
  - Population, Sample, Observations
  - distribution of a sample, distribution of a mean
    (back to the broken experiment)

  How to report the value, from basic to better

  - Point estimators: mean, variance, difference of the means

  - Statistical interval: a region that is likely to contain the true value of a parameter
    - formally, we can quantify the "level of uncertainity" associated to an interval
    - Confidence Interval, Tolerance Interval, Prediction Interval

  - Confidence interval "contains the true value of a parameters with a 
    confidence level of 100(1-alpha)" -- Confidence in the "method" used to generate
    the interval, not a confidence in the interval itself.


  * Point estimators + statistic intervals = "Descriptivie statistics", describes the world.
    - We also need "decision-making tools" -- Statistical Inference
    - Hypothesis, Testability, Falsiability
    - What are the assumptions behind the 
      hypothesis testing?

* Central Limit Theorem -- http://drwho.cpdee.ufmg.br:3838/CLT/

* Hypothesis testing
