# Ideas
- Reproducible science and its importance
  - Data organization
  - Science communication
  - Open source

- Reading a research paper
  - Order of reading, how to bulk read papers
  - Critically reading papers

- Writing papers and reports
  - Writing for reproducibility
  - Writing for clarity

- Scientific Experiments
  - Noise and uncertainties
  - Hacking and Science
  - Bad science: cargo-cult science, 5% science

- You need to love your scientific topic
  - Reading a lot
  - Keeping up with the literature (arxiv, knowing the researchers)
  - Being excited about the theme
  - Do not limit yourself to your own study

- Limitations
  - Our experiments show an indication of X and Y
  - But we did not examine the influence of Z, so maybe Z has an effect that we did not consider
  - "Future works" is not a place for advertising your work

- What is the image that we have of science? Start with examples
  - Background Cosmic Radiation
  - Limey Capitain
  - Recent example: Suicide Spikes (Medicine Discovery, Controls)
