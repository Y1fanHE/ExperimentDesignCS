This repository keeps the lecture notes and other materials for the
"Experiment Design in Computer Science (01CH740)" course at Tsukuba University, Department of Computer Sciences.

# About this Course
The collection and analysis of data through experiments is one of the cornerstones of the scientific method. In this course, we study the idea of "experimentalism" and its general methods: Why do we perform experiments, what is a good/rigorous experiment, how to plan and design a rigorous experiment, and how to perform statistical analysis on experimental data.

This course is centered around lectures with plenty of examples and study cases. The students will be invited to apply the techniques studied in this lecture to experiment of their own design.

You can also see the full [syllabus](syllabus.md) of the course.
