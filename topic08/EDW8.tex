  \frametitle{Class 3: Point and Interval Estimators}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Experimental Data can be seen as a distribution\\
    (Sample vs Population)
  \item \structure{Point Estimators}: functions that describe this
    population;
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Examples: Mean, Median, Variance, Skew
    \item Point Estimators have their own distributions, variances, etc.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \structure{Interval Estimators}: Estimate the range of values
    produced by a point estimator;
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Confidence Interval;
    \item Prediction Interval;
    \item How to calculate these;
    \end{itemize}
  \item In general we want to describe our data as intervals, because
    it includes the value of a point estimator, and a prediction of
    how much it can vary;

\section{Case Studies}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Case Studies}
  Let's see how these concepts fit together in two case studies
\end{frame}

\subsection{UFRJ Case Study}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Case 1: Comparison of Drilling Riser Configuration}
  files/CS04.pdf
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Case 1: Comparison of Drilling Riser Configuration}
  \begin{block}{How to approach this problem?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Question of interest 1: Is there a riser configuration (from
      options A, B, C) with a higher Meant Time to Failure (MTTF) than
      the standard configuration?
    \item Question of interest 2: If the answer to the question of
      interest 1 is YES, which configuration option has the highest
      Mean Time to Failure?
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Main Concerns}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Testing a riser configuration is expensive. The standard
      configuration has historical measures recorded, but each new
      observation will cost us money.
    \item Therefore, it is important to calculate beforehand the
      minimum number of observations that will be required.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Case 1: Comparison of Drilling Riser Configuration}
  \begin{block}{What tests to execute?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Because we are interested in the differences between
      multiple treatments, we initially need an ANOVA test to find out
      if they are different at all.
    \item If the ANOVA test indicates a significative difference
      between the treatments, a follow up ``all versus one'' test
      would tell us which treatments are better than the standard.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  
  \bigskip
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Because of the cost associated with each observation, we need
    to calculate in advance the sample sizes needed for the ANOVA and
    for the All versus One tests.
  \item This calculation can be done based on the required values for
    $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[singleslide,fragile]
  \frametitle{Case 1: Comparison of Drilling Riser Configuration}
  
\begin{verbatim}
> model <- aov(LogTTF-Riser,data=yriser)
> summary.aov(model)

                   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr (>F)
Riser               3   0.33  0.1108   0.439  0.725
Residuals         248  62.51  0.2521   
\end{verbatim}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{fig/riser_result}
\end{center}

\medskip

The ANOVA test tells us that the risers do not significantly differ
from the standard configuration. Before we can accept this result and
end the experiment here, we need to validate this result.

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item Shapiro-Wilk to test the normality of the data;
\item Fligner-Killeen to test that the variances of each group are homogeneous;
\item Durbin-Watson to test the lack of auto-correlation of the data;
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Scientific Communication}
\subsection{After the experiment}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Scientific Communications}
  
  \begin{center}
    Your science is only as useful as how many people know about it.
  \end{center}

  \bigskip

  So how do we make sure our results are actually used by other people?

  \smallskip

  \alert{Clarity}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{What do we mean by clarity?}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Experiment Clarity
  \item Paper Clarity
  \item Research Clarity
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Experiment Clarity}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Is the experiment \structure{reproducible}? (big one)
  \item Is the data clear and available?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Artificial Data;
    \item Real Data;
    \item Benchmark Data;
    \end{itemize}
  \item Are the conclusions clear?
  \end{itemize}

  \bigskip

  How do we write an experimental section of a paper to ensure clarity?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Paper Clarity}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Beginning from the basics: Do not forget the spell checker!
  \item Have other people proofread your paper (regardless of the language)
  \item Follow the templates (unless you have a VERY good reason not to)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Research Clarity}
  How organized is your research?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Keeping a research diary
    \item Research Versioning (vs software versioning)
    \item Keep old versions of your experiment around!
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Reasons for clarity}

  In Medical sciences, it was found that over 80\% of the results were
  not reproducible after 20 years...
  
  \bigskip

  I don't wanna think about this proportion in computer sciences.
\end{frame}

\section{Ethical Considerations}
\subsection{Plagiarism}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Plagiarism}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Basic Plagiarism
    \item Small Plagiarism (figures, data, quotes, etc)
    \item Self-plagiarism
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Fraud}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Fraud}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How to avoid fraud by keeping your data open
    \item Taking care with claims
    \item Taking care with data and results
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Ethical Experiments}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Experimenting with people}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Molchan Experiment
    \item Stanford Prison Experiment
    \item Facebook Experiment

    to Manaba.
  \end{block}
  \begin{block}{Case Studies}
    If you cannot use your own research/data for the final report, I
    have uploaded two case studies to Manaba. Choose one of those for
    your final report instead.
  \end{block}
