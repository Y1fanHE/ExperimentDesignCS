\section{Course Introduction}
\begin{frame}{What is this course about?}

  \begin{block}{From the syllabus}
  \emph{The collection and analysis of data through experiments is one of the cornerstones of the scientific method. In this course, we study the general philosophy and methods behind experimentalism: Why do we perform experiments, what is a good/rigorous experiment, how to plan and design a rigorous experiment, and how to perform statistical analysis on experimental data.}
  \end{block}

  {\bf TL;DR}: We study how to properly plan, execute, analyse and interpret an experiment (PDCA cycle!).

\begin{frame}{Motivation}
  In my years in Tsukuba, I have seen students commit the same errors many times in their presentations:
  \bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Experiments that do not control for noise factors;
    \item Comparative experiments that are not fair;
    \item Experiments that are not reproducible;
    \item Experiments that are not falsifiable;
    \item Unclear experimental conditions and assumptions;
  \end{itemize}
  \bigskip

  \structure{The final result is the same}: The experimental result does not support the conclusions of the student.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Motivation}{These problems are not limited to students}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of rigorous experimentation protocol is common in Computer Science -- It is not only students that do it!
    \bigskip

    \item The situation has gotten much better in the past five years -- you will usually have a paper rejected if you don't do proper statistical analysis of your experiments;
    \bigskip

    \item But we still have a long way to go, specially compared to Bio and Psych areas;
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{}
    We need to be careful to avoid a {\bf reproducibility crisis} in the computer sciences!
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What will you learn in this course?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How to design experiments for your own research;\bigskip

    \item How to analyse your own experimental data in a robust way;\bigskip

    \item How to read and criticize scientific experiments for robustness;\bigskip
  \end{itemize}
  \bigskip

  If your research topic requires using computational experiments to show the efficacy of your proposed methods, this course will be specially useful for you.
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Course Topics}
  \begin{itemize}

    \item What is an experiment:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Characteristics of a robust, reliable, reproducible experiment;
      \item How to design an experiment to answer a scientific question;
      \item Pitfalls to avoid when designing an experiment;
    \end{itemize}\bigskip

    \item Statistical tools for analyzing experimental data:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Basic statistics for data analysis and visualization;
      \item Statistical Inference
      \item Statistical testing for single, paired, and multiple sample testing;
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\section{Course Materials}
\begin{frame}{Course Materials}
  The materials of this course can be found on the "manaba" system: \url{https://manaba.tsukuba.ac.jp/ct/course_1354290}. If you are a member of the University of Tsukuba, but not enrolled in this course, you can still access the manaba course using the self registration code: 5685116.
  \bigskip

  If manaba is not available, or you are not part of University of Tsukuba, you can access most of the materials on the github repository for this course: \url{https://caranha.github.io/ExperimentDesignCS/}. However, report submission and some of the recommended readings are only available through manaba.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course Materials}{Lecture Notes}
  The main materials for this course are these lecture notes.
  Make sure to read them and ask questions if anything is unclear!
  \vspace{1cm}

  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.8\textwidth}
    The lecture notes were produced based on the "Design and Analysis of Experiments" material produced by Felipe Campelo. You can reach the original lecture notes on: \url{https://github.com/fcampelo/Design-and-Analysis-of-Experiments}

    \column{0.2\textwidth}

  \end{columns}
  \vspace{1cm}

  All good ideas are thanks to Felipe (and other contributors) all errors are my own :-) (Please submit errors as github issues!)
\end{frame}

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{../img/DesignAnalysis_book}
    \column{0.8\textwidth}
    Many topics in this course are explored in much more depth on "Design and Analysis of Experiments", by Douglas C. Montgomery.

  In manaba there will be a much larger list of resources for
  extra study available. Make sure to check it out!

\begin{frame}{Course Limitations}
  \hfill\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{../img/irasuto_sprout}
  \ppagenote{Sprout image from \url{https://www.irasutoya.com}}\\

  This course is just an {\bf introduction} to the ideas and tools of statistical analysis. Each experiment is different, and the specifics of your experiment might require different tools that are not described here.\bigskip

  I expect that students will see this course as a \structure{starting point} to get familiar with the basic concepts of statistical testing, and look for more specific information for their unique needs.
\end{frame}


\section{Lectures and Evaluation}

\begin{frame}{Weekly Schedule}
  The course is composed of {\bf regular lectures} and {\bf review and discussion lectures}.\bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Regular lectures}: Download the Lecture Notes from manaba or github. See the video link for a detailed discussion. Study the recommended resources.\bigskip

    \item {\bf Review and discussion}: Lecture will take place using an online meeting tool (TBD). Students may ask questions and receive feedback about their reports.
  \end{itemize}\bigskip

  Use the "Forums / 掲示板" area on manaba to ask questions too!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Course Calendar}

  \item 5/8 : Point and Interval Indicators
  \item 5/15 : Inference Testing I - {\bf Deadline Report 1}
  \item 5/22 : Inference Testing II
  \item 5/28 : Inference Testing III
  \item \alert{6/5 : Case Study, Review and Discussion}
  \item 6/12 : Power Analysis and Sample Size - {\bf Deadline Report 2}

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Grading}
  The grading of this course is based on three reports. (No final examination).
  \bigskip

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \structure{Report 1}: Submit before lecture 3 (30\%)
    \item \structure{Report 2}: Submit before lecture 7 (30\%)
    \item \structure{Report 3}: Submit 1 week after lecture 10 (40\%)
  \end{itemize}
  \bigskip

  Each report is a "mini paper", including an experiment description, data acquisition, data analysis and discussion of the results.It must use the techniques and ideas introduced in this course.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Report requirements}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The reports must be submitted in English;\medskip

    \item Besides the report text (in PDF format), the reports must include all information necessary for reproducing the analysis.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Data aquisition protocol and/or code for data generation;
      \item Code for reproducing statistical analysis and figures, including data files\footnote{It is easy to provide this data if you generate your report using R Markdown, but this is not reqired};
    \end{itemize}\medskip

    \item The report will be graded by the correctness of the analysis, and the quality of the discussion, but {\bf not} on the results of the experiments (negative results are ok!)\medskip

    \item You are encouraged (not required) to write reports based on your research!
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Others}
